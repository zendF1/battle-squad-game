# assets/

Every image the game shows is a file here. The current files are placeholder art drawn in
code (`tools/art/*.gd`) and baked by `tools/bake_art.gd`. `ui/art.gd` is the one place that maps
ids to these paths; a missing file never crashes (a character falls back to rookie, an icon to
`icons/unknown.png`, anything else to a small grey square, with a warning).

Total about 2.5 MB of PNG.

## Replacing art

- **Overwrite a PNG with the same name and the same size** (and, for characters, the same pivot).
  The editor re-imports it; nothing else changes. A different size works for icons, effects,
  clouds and backgrounds (they are drawn to a fixed on-screen size), but keep character frames on
  the shared canvas below.
- **Characters**: either overwrite the frame PNGs, or open
  `characters/<id>/<id>.tres` (SpriteFrames) in the editor and change frames, counts, speed or
  loop flags. The animation names must stay `idle`, `walk`, `shoot`, `hurt`, `die`. If you change
  the canvas size or pivot, update `FRAME_SIZE` / `FRAME_PIVOT` / `PX_PER_UNIT` in `ui/art.gd`
  and the sprite `offset` in `scenes/character/character.tscn` (= -pivot).
- **9-patches** (`ui/`): keep the corners inside the texture margins listed below
  (`ui/art.gd` `UI_BOXES`), or change the margins there.
- Import settings: icons, effects and clouds are imported with mipmaps (they are shown smaller
  than drawn); the rest without. Re-baking never touches an existing `.import` file.

## Re-baking the placeholder art

Run windowed (a headless run has no renderer), from the project folder:

```
$GODOT --path . -s tools/bake_art.gd                 # everything
$GODOT --path . -s tools/bake_art.gd -- icons ui     # only some groups
```

Groups: `characters`, `env`, `terrain`, `fx`, `icons`, `ui`, `equipment`. It overwrites the PNGs (and the
characters' `.tres`), prints each file with its size and quits. Then let the editor import them
(or run `$GODOT --headless --path . --import` while no editor is open). Baking overwrites
replaced art too: only re-bake the groups you have not replaced.

## Files

### characters/ (scene: `scenes/character/character.tscn`)

Every character holds its gun: Rookie a bazooka, Tanko a heavy cannon, Spark a shock rifle, Flora a seed launcher.

| File | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `<id>/idle_0..3.png` | 512x400 each | loops, 2.5 fps; upper body breathing |
| `<id>/walk_0..5.png` | 512x400 each | loops, 9 fps; leg swing, bob, forward lean |
| `<id>/shoot_0..2.png` | 512x400 each | once, 9 fps; recoil, muzzle flash in frame 0 at the gun's tip (`character_painter.gd` MUZZLES) |
| `<id>/hurt_0..2.png` | 512x400 each | once, 7 fps; knocked back, wobble, squint (the red flash is code) |
| `<id>/die_0..3.png` | 512x400 each | once, 8 fps, holds the last frame; falls on its back (the grey tint is code) |
| `<id>/<id>.tres` | – | SpriteFrames of the five animations |
| `<id>/portrait.png` | 128x128 | head and shoulders: Profile and Shop character cards |
| `shadow.png` | 160x38 | ground shadow under every character, centred on the feet |

`<id>` is `rookie`, `tanko`, `spark`, `flora` (about 14–34 KB per frame). **Every frame**: canvas
512x400, transparent, **feet at pixel (256, 360)** (bottom centre, the same pixel in every frame),
facing right, drawn at 1.6 px per art unit (the character is about 150 units = 240 px tall).
The game flips it for facing left. Used by the lobby stage and the Prep panel
(`ui/character_view.gd`, about 2.5 and 1.5 px per unit) and the match (`match/views/player_view.gd`,
0.35 px per unit, about 52 px tall, feet on the server position).

### env/

| File | Size | Pivot / layout | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lobby_bg.png` | 1600x900 (176 KB) | stretched over the screen | `ui/backdrop.gd` (lobby, Profile, Shop, Prep) |
| `lobby_ground.png` | 1600x360 (7 KB) | the bottom 40% of the lobby screen (hill + stage ovals), transparent above | `ui/backdrop.gd` (lobby only) |
| `pedestal.png` | 400x112 (5 KB) | the feet stand at (200, 52) | lobby stage, Prep panel (drawn at 0.66x0.6) |
| `sky_match.png` | 1600x512 (29 KB) | stretched over the map plus 600 px each side (2800x900 for the default map); sun and hills included | `match/views/sky_view.gd` |
| `cloud_0..2.png` | 288x160 (6–9 KB) | centred; drawn at half size times a random 0.7–1.4 scale | `match/views/sky_view.gd` |

### terrain/ (`match/terrain/terrain.gdshader`, set by `terrain_view.gd`)

| File | Size | Layout |
|---|---|---|
| `dirt.png` | 128x128 (12 KB) | tiles both ways, one texel per world px; the shader darkens it with depth and adds the burnt crater rim |
| `grass_edge.png` | 128x24 (1 KB) | tiles horizontally. Rows 0–5: tufts in the air above a surface (row 5 touches it). Rows 6–23: the grass band from the surface down. Transparent = air (tufts) / dirt (band) |

The terrain mask stays the source of truth: the shader only decides colours per mask pixel.

### fx/

One folder per gun (`rookie/`, `tanko/`, `spark/`, `flora/`) plus `common/` for effects every gun uses.

```
fx/
  common/   smoke.png, debris.png, muzzle.png
  rookie/   projectile.png (the bomb), impact_0..5.png (the explosion)
  tanko/    projectile.png, trail.png, impact_0..5.png
  spark/    projectile.png, trail.png, impact_0..5.png
  flora/    projectile.png, trail.png, impact_0..5.png
```

| `rookie/projectile.png` | 48x48 (2 KB) | the bazooka's bomb: ball centred, flying towards +x, fuse behind; 2 px per world px. Also the fallback projectile of every gun | `projectile_view.gd` (turned along the flight; Rookie's fuse spark and line trail are code, so Rookie has no `trail.png`) |
| `rookie/impact_0..5.png` | 256x256 (10–23 KB) | the explosion: centred; drawn for a radius-60 crater, scaled to the real radius; played over 0.5 s. Also the fallback impact of every gun | `explosion_fx.gd` |
| `<kind>/projectile.png` | 64x64 (2–5 KB) | each gun's own shell, centred, flying towards +x, 2 px per world px: `tanko/` heavy iron cannonball, `spark/` cyan plasma orb with arcs, `flora/` green seed pod with a leaf | `projectile_view.gd` (kind from the shooter's character, `STYLES`; spin, flicker, skill glow, item tint/mark in code) |
| `<kind>/trail.png` | 32x32 (1–2 KB) | the trail particle: Tanko grey smoke puff, Spark cyan spark, Flora pink petal (tinted by an item, faded in code) | `projectile_view.gd`; Spark/Flora impact bits in `explosion_fx.gd` |

### icons/equipment/ (`tools/art/equipment_painter.gd`, paths in `ui/art.gd` EQUIP_*)

| File | Size | Notes | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|

Slots `weapon`, `armor`, `helmet`, `pants`, `boots`, `gloves`; tiers `iron` (Sắt, grey), `steel` (Thép, blue steel), `mithril` (teal), `dragon` (Rồng, red + gold) for shop items, `silver` (Bạc), `gold` (Vàng), `titan`, `diamond` (Kim cương) for crafted ones. A normal item's tier comes from its name / id (`screens/home/equipment_model.gd` `tier()`); an unknown tier draws as iron | Shop → Trang bị, Túi đồ, Nhân vật slots and list, piece popup, Prep gear row |
| `weapon_<tier>.png` | 128x128 | weapons are guns: the generic blaster pistol per tier (retired generic weapons, crafted Silver/Gold/Titan/Diamond Blaster); also the empty weapon slot's shape | as above |

The kind comes from the item's `characterId` (`equipment_model.gd` `weapon_kind()`); a missing or not yet imported file falls back to `weapon_<tier>.png` | as above |

| `button_primary.png` | 104x110 | 36, 36, 36, 42 (+12 glow outside the button) | the big yellow buttons (BẮT ĐẦU, VÀO TRẬN, Về sảnh) |
| `button_primary_pressed.png` | 104x110 | 36, 36, 36, 42 (+12 glow) | the same, pressed |

Hover and pressed states are the same image, lighter or darker (`modulate`). Panels in other
colours (HUD, cards) stay plain `StyleBoxFlat` in code.
